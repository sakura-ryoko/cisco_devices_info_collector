# Idea
This script was written to collect inventory information from Cisco networking equipment.
#
# Information about script
The script supports the following types of equipment:
#
• Cisco IOS and IOS-XE devices. (always works well)

• Cisco WLC. (always works well)

• Cisco SMB (SG300). (does not always work well, sometimes does not work)

• Cisco SMB (SG350, SG500). (50/50 - but sometimes it works)
#
The script saves the following useful information to the “inventory.xlsx” file:
#
• Ip address

• device type

• hostname

• pid

• sn

• os

• uptime (* not for Cisco SMB)
#
In addition, the script saves the full output of commands to a separate text file "raw_parsed_output.txt"
#
At runtime, the script uses the following commands:
#
• Cisco IOS and IOS-XE: 'show cdp neighbors', 'show inventory', 'show version'

• Cisco WLC:: 'show cdp neighbors detail', 'show inventory', 'show sysinfo'
#

\# Requirements (As Generated by Google Gemini)

The script requires the following Python modules.

\## Why were these requirements updated?

The requirements list has been revised to support the upgrade to \*\*Modern Python (3.12+)\*\* and to enable significant performance improvements:

\* \*\*Modernization \& Type Safety:\*\* Added `dataclasses` and `typing` to replace unstructured dictionaries with formal objects. This makes the code robust, readable,and ready for Python 3.14.

\* \*\*Cross-Platform Stability:\*\* Added `pathlib` to replace error-prone string manipulation for file paths, ensuring the script runs safely on both Windows and Linux.

\* \*\*Professional Logging:\*\* Added `logging` to replace basic print statements, allowing for better debugging and error tracking without cluttering the console.

\* \*\*New Functionality:\*\* Added `csv` to support the new feature of exporting inventory results to a common CSV file alongside the Excel report.

\* \*\*High-Speed Concurrency:\*\* Optimized the usage of `concurrent.futures` to support \*\*150 parallel threads\*\* (up from 3), drastically reducing execution time.

\## Module List

\### Standard Library (Included with Python 3.12+)

•   `import sys`          # System-specific parameters and functions

•   `import time`         # To pause execution

•   `import re`           # To use regular expressions

•   `import ipaddress`    # To validate and iterate over IP address ranges efficiently

•   `import platform`     # To check OS type (Windows/Linux) for ping arguments

•   `import subprocess`   # To run OS commands, such as "ping"

•   `import getpass`      # To input password in safe mode

•   `import logging`      # \*\*(New)\*\* To handle verbose logging and error tracking

•   `import csv`          # \*\*(New)\*\* To export results to CSV format

•   `from pathlib import Path` # \*\*(New)\*\* To handle file paths safely across operating systems

•   `from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor, as\_completed`   # For high-speed parallel execution

•   `from dataclasses import dataclass, field` # \*\*(New)\*\* To structure device data efficiently

•   `from typing import Any, Optional` # \*\*(New)\*\* For type hinting and code clarity


\### Third-Party Libraries (Must be installed)

•   `from netmiko import ConnectHandler, SSHDetect`      # To work with network equipment

•   `import paramiko`     # Underlying SSH client for connections and manual detection

•   `import textfsm`      # To parse output of equipment using templates

•   `from tabulate import tabulate`    # To format output as tables

•   `import xlsxwriter`   # To save the files in Excel format


\## Installation

Make sure that you have all the necessary third-party modules installed before you run the script.
You can install them using the generated requirements file:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

#
Make sure that you have all the necessary modules installed before you run the script.

\## Future plans
- Perhaps someone with actual Python knowledge can follow up from Gemini's modernization code.
